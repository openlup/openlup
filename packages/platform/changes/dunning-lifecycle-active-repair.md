- Keep active subscriptions active on dunning exhaustion (invariant repair).

Migration: apply the complete portable catalogue through
`20261021120000_dunning_lifecycle_active_repair.sql` at position 71. Previously,
NULL next retry expired the case and paused an active subscription; it now leaves
the case open and repairable, retains the final notice and exhaustion event, and
changes no subscription or cycle dates. Existing rows are not rewritten. Pass
NULL only when `isDunningLadderExhausted` holds; a class-terminated rung-one refusal
still must not be passed as NULL. There is no managed twin yet; the managed
baseline still needs a separate forward.
