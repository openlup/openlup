### Added

- Experimental operations contracts/browser/server subpaths expose existing
  settings, pipeline-read, alert overview, watchdog delivery and control-plane
  behavior through injected host ports. The public reference binds these owners.

### Migration

- Existing reference imports remain compatible. Select the new operations entries
  explicitly; imports register no route, job or provider. Identity membership and
  tracking effects retain their existing owners.
- Native control-plane storage requires the complete canonical native prefix,
  including the job ledger and `20260814010000_platform_control_plane.sql`.
  The packaged SQL is a sparse unchanged projection. Supply current capability-local
  operator authority, routine EXECUTE and underlying relation grants; no managed
  parity or hosted-provider certification is established.
