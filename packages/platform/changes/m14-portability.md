### Added

Add the experimental Node-only `@openlup/platform/portability` entry for verified,
bounded object copy/resume and compatible PostgreSQL row capture/restore through
injected transaction handles. Object reads distinguish absent, denied and
unavailable; private filesystem publication preserves bytes, metadata and source
lineage with an explicit process-owner access policy. Row replay is exact and
conflicts refuse atomically; every enabled user INSERT trigger refuses.

The bounded M14 B budget read approved the measured code-gzip minimum of
1,650,493 bytes, an increase of 2,493 bytes from 1,648,000. This allocates no
additional forecast headroom. Other byte, file, docs and browser limits and the
released baseline are unchanged by this decision; later candidates still need
their own actual package measurement.

### Migration

Select the entry explicitly. Install the canonical target catalogue
and qualify the source/target privileges separately; this API does not install
schema, copy migration ledgers, map managed identities or activate executors.
Changed-row catch-up, guarded-domain import and hosted effect-time fencing remain
M14 dependencies. Local synthetic proof does not certify complete-store transfer,
provider revocation or a stable migration service.
