# Changelog

Notable changes to this public-source workspace package are recorded here.
“Unreleased” means no npm version carries the change yet; immutable OpenLup
source previews may already ship some changes, and their release notes say
which. Declaration snapshots track candidate drift, not a stable API or
SemVer promise.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.0]

- Publishable on the npm `latest` dist-tag as `0.21.0`, from tag
  `openlup-platform-v0.21.0`.
- Preview set: core/outbox unchanged, UI private `0.0.0`; published `0.20.0` size baselines, unchanged caps.

### Cumulative M07 status: C2 code-complete

- Experimental payments/contracts/runtime: unchanged prepared ordering; neutral execution/evidence/readback/conformance, verified truth, first-receipt ingress, method lifecycle/reconciliation; host-owned persistence, translation/failure policy.
- Native PostgreSQL truth/settlement/later-only alignment; three unchanged sparse SQL projections, not an install chain. Refunds never cancel subscriptions.
- Repair/recovery/buyer verify inject rail capabilities; unknown rails refuse. Reference BFF retains mapping/schemas/ownership/auth order/transient callbacks. Browser/verify outcomes never prove payment success.
- Opt-in repair view: `commerce/paymentStatusClient`, `commerce/paymentVerifyClient`, `payment/components/PaymentStatusPoller`; stored paid alone confirms, redirects require HTTPS, collection/confirmation stay injected, unsupported setup is visible. Exact file/specifier guards refuse broad commerce/operator clients; source-import proof keeps default view unmounted.
- Truth services/one optional named binder use the host executor, no new schedule/executor. Selectors default-off: nothing activates by default. First-insert adapter fingerprint excludes receipt time/audit.
- Two experimental example adapter subpaths under `./payments/`, named in the README. Card-processor example: three frozen exports, injected host client/neutral ports; refund creation, split authorization/capture and exact absence unavailable; cancellation needs host support.
- Regional-processor example: host I/O, Model O aliases, verified observations, purpose-sensitive readback; check certificate validity/notification freshness. Both examples have no import I/O/default binding and await account TEST evidence.
- Advisory: mismatched nonzero refusal money stays unknown/manual; trusted document refusals mean customer data correction; configuration mismatches throw before I/O. Unpaid/transient no-dispatch classifications unchanged.
- Settling money missing/invalid/non-positive or blank currency refuses as amount mismatch; conformance requires positive money. Empty optional transients stop false leak refusals; JSON-escaped transients in diagnostics/readbacks/stored payloads and payer contact in execution results now refuse.
- Private types reuse canonical money/attempts; unused imports removed, runtime/API unchanged.

Migration: upgrade all `@openlup/*` `0.20.0` → `0.21.0` for exact pins. No schema migration; install the canonical catalogue, not sparse projections. Attempts add optional method selection/transient payer contact; contact is dispatch-only, never persisted/audited/logged/diagnosed. Missing adapter-required input requires exact before-dispatch `notDispatched`. Registration refs/kind/status require host `resolveMethodOwner` client/subscription ownership or are omitted. Lifecycle/normalized nested audit copies typed fields only; conformance scans all for secrets/contact. Adapter-filtered redacted audit never stores raw bodies; typed evidence overrides reader facts, audit bag fills untyped facts; identity/fingerprint exclude bag/receipt time. Other changes need no migration/automatic host rewiring.

Migration: F2 replaces assumed full refund with `require-evidence`: missing/null kind/amount/operation identity is durably recorded/acknowledged, not applied. Supply original money, stable operation identity and cumulative snapshot, event delta or explicit full reversal (`refund`/`chargeback`); full evidence stays valid. Former default needs `refundEvidencePolicy: "legacy-assume-full"`, also in the reference handler; no native parity implied.

Migration: D11 changes every caller of the reference payment control port (the selected verified ingress, the existing provider webhook handler and the captured reference checkout): apply/post-process redelivery using the first stored receipt instant, not redelivery time, so it cannot shift the cycle again. Replay reads winning receipt evidence and refuses (503) when that instant is unavailable. A legacy pre-fingerprint row takes the later clock once. Retain receipt evidence on upgrade; provider routes are not switched to opt-in ingress.

### Known limitations

- Portable dunning repair has no managed twin: exhaustion still pauses active subscriptions there; retaining active status needs a managed forward.
- D8-1: native advisory v2 promo-code candidates/rejection details unavailable.
- D8-2: native mounted v2 issue/honor/fallback unavailable.
- D8-3: native acquisition-only mounted issuance/honor unavailable.
- D8-4: full native/managed eligibility equivalence unavailable.
- Bundle-1: independent DB human-only actor-kind enforcement absent natively; first in the native-backend parity round.
- Bundle-2: managed-equivalent actor-kind/email history absent natively.
- Bundle-3 closes injected-reader M05 mounted admin/feed readback only. Native new-purchase stock read absent despite P5a installed-store proof; deferred second after bundle-1 (owner 2026-10-21); readiness refuses.
- Bundle-4: incumbent real-PostgreSQL contention only; no exactly-once guarantee.
- Managed schema/pgTAP retain `44.404`; removal needs owner decision/forward; reference composition supplies it to app code.
- A1 offline only; account/hosted-time/owner TEST evidence unclaimed; `communications/klaviyo` verification-pending.
- M05 omitted opt-ins preserve defaults/outputs/read order/schedules/refusals/acceptance-token bytes/SQL.
- Native inventory adjustment unavailable; address writes refuse readiness. Flat-rate save needs selected port/Core readiness/applied-seed observation.
- Native shipping audit unavailable; handler swallows best-effort audit failure.
- Native flat-rate integer bounds (0 through host maximum; reference 100,000 minor units) use request schema, not DB CHECK.
- Managed ATP/forecast/dated-supply/pagination readback unproved/pending M06.
- Managed two-session locks/concurrency/uncovered compensation unproved/pending M06.
- Managed exact-prefix upgrade/ledger unproved/pending M06.
- Managed address idempotency/conflict/readback unproved/pending M06.
- Managed successful flat-rate read/save unproved/pending host authority.
- M06 stock-wait lifecycle/durable timing/staging controls retain C5/C6; busy/try-gate, continuity/flag/TTL transfers are dispositions, not PASS.
- Shipping national-registry fields/locale-specific `canonicalAddressKey` fold await M16 host market pack/key migration; reference shipping copy stays locale-specific until M16.
- Native durable prepared storage, method setup, absence reopen and cumulative refunds unavailable; no production installation parity claimed.
- Typed refusal-envelope forwarding unavailable (`failureReason` only); reusable registration needs host ownership resolution.
- Incomplete chargebacks stay refunds/unapplied: reclassification bypasses evidence validation into dispute apply; limited operator recovery.
- Audit compatibility still detects `chargeId`; refund operation identity/original money supply no typed charge identity.
- M07 follow-up: repair poll can clear host redirect; post-timeout verify never restarts polling; unlocalized poller; fixture builds/never calls handler.
- M07 follow-up: reference status route wrong-rail witness.
- M07 follow-up: explicit reference-route refusal for unsupported method setup.
- M07 follow-up: deployment-neutral disabled-verify reason.
- M07 follow-up: reference card normalizer missing-amount path; package settling evidence already requires positive money.

## [0.20.0]

- Publishable on the npm `latest` dist-tag as `0.20.0`, from tag
  `openlup-platform-v0.20.0`.

- Refresh release size-gate baselines from the published `0.19.0` tarballs; all caps remain unchanged.

- Keep active subscriptions active on portable dunning exhaustion (invariant repair).

Migration: apply the complete portable catalogue through
`20261021120000_dunning_lifecycle_active_repair.sql` at position 71. Previously,
NULL next retry expired the case and paused an active subscription; it now leaves
the case open and repairable, retains the final notice and exhaustion event, and
changes no subscription or cycle dates. Existing rows are not rewritten. Pass
NULL only when `isDunningLadderExhausted` holds; a class-terminated rung-one refusal
still must not be passed as NULL. There is no managed twin yet; the managed
baseline still needs a separate forward.

- Add the readiness-gated native flat-rate binding; the host supplies the named
  role-free lane and fixed-key rate port, as in the reference composition.
- Require the native port and Core readiness for the shipping seed migration.
- Refuse missing-row saves; native audit remains explicitly unsupported and best effort.

Migration:
Apply the complete portable chain through 20261021200000_shipping_flat_rate_seed.
The seed preserves an existing rate and inserts zero only when absent; no ACL or
role changes are made. New code on an unmigrated schema keeps refusing. Older code
reads the seeded zero as it read an absent row. An application rollback does not reverse either forward
(positions 71 and 72), and older runners refuse the extended ledger.
Managed host-save authority remains pending.

- Add the shipping `SHIPPING_MIGRATIONS` export and the optional
  `nativeRateReadiness` / `nativeRateSchema` binding dependencies.

Migration: upgrade the complete `@openlup/*` set from `0.19.0` to `0.20.0`
for exact internal pins. Native rate bindings require the selected port plus
Core readiness and a same-database schema observation of the applied seed.
Install the complete canonical migration catalogue, never sparse package
projections as an installation chain.

### Cumulative M06 status

- M06 remains incomplete: inventory and shipping are development-preview
  surfaces, with managed-host proof classes pending.
- Inventory and shipping contracts, stock/ATP reads, reserve/release/expire
  operations, subscription forecasts, delivery selection, address and flat-rate
  handlers first shipped in `0.18.0`. Opt-in inventory/shipping/composition
  bindings (P5a/P5b) first shipped in `0.19.0`. M06's only new behaviour in
  `0.20.0` is native flat-rate save behind readiness; the portable dunning
  invariant repair is separate from M06. Host-owned policy and unsupported
  operations retain their explicit boundaries.

### Known limitations

- The portable dunning invariant repair has no managed twin in this set. The
  managed baseline pauses active subscriptions on exhaustion; keeping them active
  requires a separate managed forward. Portable proof does not establish managed parity.

- D8-1: native advisory v2 promo-code candidates and rejection details are not supported on the native backend.
- D8-2: native mounted v2 code issue/honor/fallback is not supported on the native backend.
- D8-3: acquisition-only mounted issuance/honor is not supported on the native backend.
- D8-4: full native/managed eligibility equivalence is not supported on the native backend.
- Bundle-1: independent database human-only actor-kind enforcement is not supported on the native backend and is the first item of a future native-backend parity round.
- Bundle-2: managed-equivalent actor-kind/email history is not supported on the native backend.
- Bundle-3 remains closed for M05 mounted admin/feed readback with an injected stock reader, while native new-purchase stock reads remain unsupported despite P5a's installed native inventory-store read proof.
- Bundle-4 establishes only incumbent real-PostgreSQL contention characterization and provides no exactly-once guarantee.
- The managed baseline schema and its pgTAP tests retain the incumbent legacy value `44.404`; removing it needs a forward migration and an owner decision, while reference composition supplies that value to application code.
- A1 evidence is offline only: account verification, hosted-time behaviour and owner TEST certification are not claimed, and the `communications/klaviyo` adapter's capabilities stay verification-pending.
- M05 parity seams are opt-in and omitted bindings preserve incumbent defaults, outputs, read order, scheduling, refusals, acceptance-token bytes and exported SQL.
- Native inventory adjustment remains unsupported; native address writes refuse
  required-capability readiness. Native flat-rate save is supported only behind
  the selected port, Core readiness and applied-seed schema observation.
- Native new-purchase stock read is deferred to the native-backend parity round
  (owner 2026-10-21), second after M05 bundle-1; required readiness still refuses
  honestly.
- Native shipping-rate save has no durable audit: audit is explicitly unsupported,
  and the incumbent handler swallows the best-effort audit failure.
- Native flat-rate value bounds (integer, 0 <= value <= the host request schema's
  maximum) are enforced by that schema, not a database CHECK; the reference
  maximum is 100,000 minor units.
- Managed host ATP/forecast/dated-supply/pagination readback is not proved and
  remains pending in the M06 ledger; no managed-host parity is claimed.
- Managed two-session lock order/concurrency and uncovered compensation paths
  are not proved on a managed host and remain pending; no equivalence is claimed.
- Managed exact-prefix upgrade/ledger is not proved on a managed host and remains
  pending; no managed installation equivalence is claimed.
- Managed address adapter idempotency/conflict/readback is not proved on a managed
  host and remains pending; no fixture-to-host equivalence is claimed.
- Managed successful flat-rate read/save remains pending host authority and is
  not proved on a managed host; no successful managed host-save claim is made.
- M06 adopter stock-wait lifecycle, durable subscription timing and staging
  control observations retain their separate C5/C6 evidence gates. Busy/try-gate
  protocol, durable stock-wait continuity and staging flag/TTL rows transferred
  to C5 adopter evidence are dispositions, not PASS.
- Shipping contracts retain national-registry address fields and
  `canonicalAddressKey` retains a locale-specific character fold. M16 owns their
  move behind a host-supplied market pack with a canonical-key migration plan.
- Reference shipping UI copy remains locale-specific until M16.

## [0.19.0]

- Publishable on the npm `latest` dist-tag as `0.19.0`, from tag
  `openlup-platform-v0.19.0`.

### 0.18.0 → 0.19.0 set scope

- Prepare the complete development-preview minor set at `0.19.0`, including everything on main since `0.18.0`; core and outbox are unchanged republications, and UI stays private `0.0.0`.
- M05 parity adds opt-in shipping-promise consent, post-discount threshold shipping and acquisition orchestration to the experimental pricing, promotions and shipping entries; financial policy and acquisition capability remain host supplied.
- M05 parity adds effective native bundle selection and an authoritative preview hook, optional resolved-target/detail/feed context fields and `selectEffectiveBundleTargetPrice`; effective feeds require unambiguous gross unit anchors and whole-BOM readiness.
- Add `createConcurrentCommercePriceAuthorityPort` with concurrent history scheduling, selected-list identity and base-refusal precedence; browser additions are type-only.
- Catalog/contracts draft canonical JSON detects lone surrogates without regex lookbehind so it loads in Safari before 16.4, with unchanged behavior.
- M06 P5a adds explicit inventory store/provider bindings and structural inventory contribution, keeping reference catalog-stock composition inert and managed authorization intact; native new-purchase stock reads remain unsupported pending an owner decision and native adjustment still refuses.
- M06 P5a retains focused installed-consumer, runtime-role, managed FEFO/adjustment and consume/refund replay evidence with unproved parity gates retained in the M06 ledger.
- M06 P5b adds opt-in shipping selection, address and flat-rate bindings with injected validation and authority; native address writes remain unsupported and refuse required readiness.
- M06 P5b adds the final isolated installed inventory/shipping consumer, preserving incumbent selection errors and flat-rate behavior.
- M06 in progress: inventory and shipping entries are early surfaces; module not complete
- Supporting main changes sort platform registration lists one item per line and use the database clock in the M05 P7 quote witness; neither adds runtime behavior.

Migration: upgrade the complete `@openlup/*` set from `0.18.0` to `0.19.0` for exact internal pins; existing bindings need no change and new module adoption remains explicit and experimental. Hosts selecting shipping promises must forward `shippingTerms` through both acceptance callbacks and use a context schema that preserves the selected terms. Bind `resolveQuoteShippingPromotions` to the promotions factory to select the bounded two-pass threshold path; financial policy and acquisition capability remain host supplied. The additive APIs require a minor set and introduce no activation. For both M05 24b and M06 P5b, the pricing and promotions API reports reorder existing enum/union members because declaration emit order changed (24b follows the catalog-to-pricing import); no member is added, removed or changed and callers need no migration for that reorder. Install the complete canonical migration catalogue, never sparse package projections as an installation chain; this preparation adds no SQL migration.

### Known limitations

- D8-2: native mounted v2 code issue/honor/fallback is not supported on the native backend.
- D8-3: acquisition-only mounted issuance/honor is not supported on the native backend.

- Bundle-4 establishes only incumbent real-PostgreSQL contention characterization and provides no exactly-once guarantee.
- The managed baseline schema and its pgTAP tests retain the incumbent legacy value `44.404`; removing it needs a forward migration and an owner decision, while reference composition supplies that value to application code.
- A1 evidence is offline only: account verification, hosted-time behaviour and owner TEST certification are not claimed, and the `communications/klaviyo` adapter's capabilities stay verification-pending.
- M05 parity seams are opt-in and omitted bindings preserve incumbent defaults, outputs, read order, scheduling, refusals, acceptance-token bytes and exported SQL.
- Native inventory adjustment remains unsupported; native address writes and flat-rate saves refuse required-capability readiness.
- M06 managed host ATP/forecast/supply/pagination, remaining compensation/concurrency/lock-order, exact-prefix upgrade/ledger, address idempotency/conflict/readback and runtime rate authority remain pending in the M06 ledger.
- M06 adopter stock-wait lifecycle, durable subscription timing and staging control observations retain their separate C5/C6 evidence gates.

### Size note

Only platform `pack.docs.maxPackedBytes` rises from 40,960 to 49,152 B; all other caps and budgets remain unchanged. All three baselines use integrity-verified published `0.18.0` tarballs.

Question (2026-10-21): "The platform package's root docs (README + CHANGELOG) will exceed their 40,960 B gzip cap at the next release. What should we do?"
Owner's answer: "Raise to 49,152 B (Recommended)"
Option description shown to the owner: "Same figure as core. Unblocks the next few releases; the CHANGELOG grows every release, so this cap would otherwise block each one."
Recorded as an owner decision taken through the coordinator's question on 2026-10-21.

Earlier releases (0.18.0 and older) are recorded verbatim in `packages/platform/CHANGELOG-HISTORY.md` in the source repository.
