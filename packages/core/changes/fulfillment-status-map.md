- Keep the shared fulfillment status facade and generated JSON neutral; provider dictionaries own translation. Canonical `packed` remains preferred and every historical display alias keeps its customer-step result.

Migration: shared status-map JSON no longer carries adapter trace columns. Consumers needing provider translation use adapter-owned dictionaries. Existing status tokens, ranks, effects and customer steps are unchanged.
