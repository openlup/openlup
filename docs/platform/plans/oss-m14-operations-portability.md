# Operations and existing-store portability

Status: development-preview implementation in progress. Draft contributions do
not establish supported hosting, provider certification, migration readiness or
stable-framework acceptance.

## Outcome and authority

The accountable maintainer authorized M14 implementation and independent review,
with Codex coordinating named workstreams and bounded subagents. The first
external delivery endpoint is reviewed, appropriately verified, stacked **draft
pull requests**. That grant includes scoped local work, signed commits and draft
submission. It does not authorize ready conversion, merge-queue arming, merge,
package publication, provider activation, account/settings/credential operations,
real-store cutover or production deployment. Required API/security/control reads
and native evidence remain applicable. Technical review is delegated and does
not assert personal maintainer reading of every diff.

The module preserves operational behavior while supplying public lifecycle
capabilities for an existing synthetic store: compatible install/upgrade,
managed-to-portable and portable-to-portable transfer, interrupted operation,
DB/object/external-effect recovery and controlled executor handover. Preserve
identity/ACL/history, active subscriptions, frozen terms, unsettled amounts,
pending duties and idempotency/outbox/provider ledgers. Domain commands and
truth remain with their existing owners. Executor isolation does not pause a
subscription or discard obligations. An undelivered replacement is never marked
delivered; actual late arrival extends a cycle later once.

The source and initial policy base is
`80d27906a6d4bc679c011871948e88d185bb1c63`. Later exact candidate/predecessor
pins, authors, paths, review findings and commands belong to each workstream's
task record and native session. No implementation review PASS is recorded here.

## Workstreams and first useful candidates

These initial boundaries separate current operations from new lifecycle work;
they do not make a subset equal to whole-module completion.

| Workstream | Owned source and proof | First useful result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operations | `packages/platform/src/operations/`, its package tests and reference composition | Existing settings/pipeline/alerts/control-plane behavior, typed injected authority, watchdog delivery/heartbeat/replay/refusal, useful installed consumer. |
| Existing-store transfer and recovery | `packages/platform/src/portability/`, its package tests and source/target adapters | Authenticated consistent object copy/resume, explicit compatible-data transport/mappings and effect-time ownership experiment; unsupported handover refuses honestly. |
| App upgrade | `packages/platform/src/lifecycle/`, its package tests and supported recipe consumers | Conservative app-owned-file plan/apply, pre-write conflict refusal and interrupted resume; caller schema-range input is separate from actual database compatibility. |
| Portable installation compatibility | Existing canonical migration/role/manifest owners; exact implementation paths pending the bounded control decision | Resolve restricted-admin, distinct runtime-login and domain import-trigger gaps without rewriting history, bypassing controls or duplicating the runner. Source-only decision first. |

Use isolated platform subpaths under the
[package-placement decision](../ARCHITECTURE_AND_EXTENSIONS.md#package-placement-decision-canonical).
Browser-safe contracts are isolated from Node/provider infrastructure. Existing
data, migration, scheduler, identity and domain-effect rails are reused; no
universal dispatcher, second domain engine, generic ETL framework, new proof
registry or always-on transfer coordinator is justified by this plan.

One integration owner serializes shared manifests/exports/module graph/API
snapshots, migration/source/publication descriptors, reference composition and
documentation navigation. The bottom operations candidate gets an exact bounded
shared-file handoff first. Other disjoint source work can proceed in parallel;
upper branches incorporate final predecessors before counted review. Exact PR
ordering and boundaries are recorded when the candidates stabilize, not inferred
from workstream names. Existing earlier work retains priority.

## Concrete fit limits and recovery questions

- The public migration runner applies an ordered exact catalogue with
  ledger-prefix/object-inventory checks and an advisory lock. It is not a
  filesystem upgrade planner, data transfer or restore command. Preserve its
  history and checks; target schema comes from canonical migrations, with
  compatible data transported separately and only necessary explicit mappings.
- The generic gateway has actor/service role lanes, while capability-local
  stores can use role-free transactions. Real selected operations and their
  intended login/grants must be inventoried; owner-only tests do not prove the
  deployed capability. Both installer-managed and operator-provisioned models
  require explicit preflight.
- The current acquisition foundation requires a superuser migration login and
  binds the sole runtime-role membership to that login. The actor-auth forward
  creates cluster-global roles unconditionally. Restricted administrators,
  distinct runtime logins and existing clusters therefore have unresolved
  compatibility requirements. Do not rewrite/skip immutable history, widen
  grants silently or label those installation models supported. A compatible
  canonical repair/catalogue decision remains an explicit module dependency.
- Ordinary sign-in reconciliation does not migrate identity between issuers.
  The exact issuer/subject derives the OIDC principal; an already linked email
  cannot be overwritten. Transfer must account for dependent customer/operator
  memberships, erasures/challenges and credential/session limitations.
- Normal blob interfaces supply URLs, upload/list/exists/delete but not a
  complete authenticated byte/version/access export. Existing exists semantics
  can collapse storage errors to false. A transfer-specific server capability
  must distinguish absence, denial and unavailability, traverse all pages and
  reconcile bytes plus ownership/access at a consistent DB/object point.
- Restoring a database clones claim tokens, generations, versions and leases.
  Locks in independent databases cannot exclude an old process. Pause a worker
  after admission immediately before provider dispatch, hand over, then resume
  it while the new instance reconciles an accepted-before-ACK effect and late
  observation. Actual old egress must refuse through independently enforced
  authority; a startup-only or cached static check is insufficient. Assess
  existing deployment/provider enforcement before a new persistent service.

These are named feasibility/proof gaps, not new defects accepted as harmless.
Bounded useful drafts may disclose still-owed whole-module work; safe refusal
does not make a permanently unusable transfer a completed outcome.

## Proof and verification

Extend existing package/installed-consumer and disposable PostgreSQL harnesses.
Use neutral synthetic data, ordinary granted roles and meaningful failing
counterexamples. New module evidence must execute actual consumer behavior,
not merely validate interfaces or count exported names.

| Changed boundary | Required useful evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Operations/API | Current behavior and exact typed requests/results, authorization/input/output refusals, replay/conflict/checkOnly/restart; cold installed consumer without optional SDK or workspace leakage. |
| Roles/schema | Actual allowed domain write, forbidden neighboring operation and absent-grant refusal under the selected login; fresh/existing-state compatibility and hostile caller where applicable. |
| Transfer | Connected existing-store data, exact numeric/time/ID values, source writes/catch-up, interrupted copy/resume and complete count/value/ownership/ACL/object reconciliation. |
| Object recovery | Nested/multipage/private objects, denied read, interruption and overwrite between DB snapshot and byte read; no unreadable object reported absent. |
| Effect recovery | External acceptance, crash before ACK, older snapshot, old/new actors and late observation; no duplicate/loss or explicit safe refusal, controlled ownership and measured recovery point/time. |
| App upgrade | A real outside-workspace two-version app with customized/unmanaged files, divergent managed-file refusal before writes, interruption after one write and resumed application; schema compatibility distinct from file planning. |
| Recipes | One factored PostgreSQL conformance kit and explicit Node/OIDC/S3/host configuration; hosted results only when actually observed under scope. No cloud cross-product or stable claim from local fixtures. |

Use cheap structural/lint/published-tree typecheck, API/boundary/artifact and
affected behavior checks before counted review and final verification. Complete
mandatory full native verification for the applicable frozen candidate; focused
green never replaces it. Draft/skipped hosted checks do not prove admission.
Two independent fresh full reviewers cover material/sensitive candidates, one
considering a simpler solution. Preserve native findings/cycles/expiry and
exact predecessor pins. Do not review known-changing bases or repeatedly run
full gates while outputs are still changing. Follow the existing resource
broker and native sibling-held lock rules; no new gate or runner is installed.

## Measurements and completion evidence

Current package headroom, module test baseline/used budget, hosted timing and
recovery measurements are not yet established by this record. Measure existing
artifact caps and required test costs before expansion and cumulatively at
useful candidates. A measured crossing takes its competent maintainer budget
route; another package/agent does not create additional budget.

Final module acceptance retains complete existing-store transfer/recovery,
upgrade and applicable recipes, including missing install/handover seams above.
Final exact-release hosting/distribution/independent-adopter acceptance retains
its owning later integration boundary; it cannot excuse an M14-owned missing
operation or default. No real-store or production action follows from local
evidence. Each delivered draft records actual checks, review findings, remaining
dependencies and a short terminal self-retro. This plan grants no additional
authority or automatic successor work.
