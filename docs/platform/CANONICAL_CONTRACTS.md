# Canonical Contracts

Status: development-preview contract. These rules define the intended public
behavioural boundary; they do not assert a stable provider catalogue or release.

## Canonical status

Each domain owns its canonical status vocabulary, allowed transitions, and
terminal-state rules. A provider's raw status is evidence at the adapter edge;
it is mapped into a domain fact before it affects durable platform state.

Do not compare provider strings throughout application code or treat a browser
return value as settlement truth. Preserve the raw evidence needed for diagnosis
in a bounded form, map it once, and refuse impossible transitions. Late,
duplicate, or out-of-order evidence must not regress a terminal canonical fact.

Status vocabularies are not interchangeable between domains. A new status or
transition requires an explicit mapping, persistence compatibility, and tests
for refusal, replay, and ordering.

## Idempotency

Every externally repeatable write has an idempotency scope, a stable operation
identity, and a request fingerprint. Replaying the same logical request returns
the established result without a second durable effect. Reusing a key for a
different fingerprint is a conflict, not permission to overwrite history.

Idempotency keys are opaque values with documented derivation and scope. An
operation, a provider attempt, a customer journey, and an inbound event may
require different keys; do not collapse them into one user-controlled value.
Persist the ledger before reporting success, and make concurrent repeats resolve
to one canonical effect.

## Provider adapters

Domain code depends on a port, not on a provider SDK. An adapter translates the
provider protocol, verification evidence, and failure facts into the port's
neutral contract. It must carry the platform's identity fields without changing
their meaning and expose declared capabilities rather than relying on provider
name checks in domain policy.

An adapter needs conformance coverage for success, refusal, malformed or missing
evidence, duplicate delivery, out-of-order delivery, and retry/replay. Reference
fixtures demonstrate these behaviours without live provider access; they do not
prove a provider integration, release, or support tier.

## Subscription delivery alignment

An active subscription must not admit its next renewal while the customer is
still waiting for the preceding delivery. Renewal admission records durable
protection for an undelivered obligation; an already-created
`retry_scheduled` cycle remains existing recovery authority rather than a new
renewal. A delivery that resolves the delay moves `next_cycle_at` to the
delivery or confirmation instant plus the stored cadence. The durable update is
monotonic and uses SQL `GREATEST`, so alignment may extend a cycle but never
move it earlier or stack deliveries on the customer.

A replacement parcel does not erase the obligation merely because it was
created or dispatched. Once a row names an earlier parcel through
`replaces_fulfillment_order_id`, that superseded predecessor is no longer an
outstanding obligation; the latest unsuperseded replacement remains outstanding
until it reaches the customer. Its arrival may settle the predecessor's case as
`aligned` without fabricating `delivered_at` for the parcel that never arrived.

`subscription_delivery_alignment_confirm_replacement` is the service-only path
for recording that a substitute shipment reached the customer when durable
delivery evidence cannot do so. Never use it for an in-flight, lost, or otherwise
undelivered replacement: `aligned` means the delivery happened. Replaying an
already aligned confirmation returns the stored aligned schedule and must not
add another cadence. The ordinary operator-resolution path refuses while an
active subscription still has an unsuperseded undelivered parcel; refusal leaves
the protected case and schedule unchanged.

These are source and persistence contracts, not evidence that any hosted
deployment, provider adapter, or public release has activated the rail.

## Compatibility posture

Stable status, idempotency, and provider-extension commitments wait for `P1-SF`.
Before then, changes must still preserve the contracts above and state their
preview compatibility boundary explicitly.
