# Canonical Contracts

Status: development-preview contract. These rules define the intended public
behavioural boundary; they do not assert a stable provider catalogue or release.

## Canonical status

Each domain owns its canonical status vocabulary, allowed transitions, and
terminal-state rules. A provider's raw status is evidence at the adapter edge;
it is mapped into a domain fact before it affects durable platform state.

Do not compare provider strings throughout application code or treat a browser
return value as settlement truth. Preserve the raw evidence needed for diagnosis
in a bounded form, map it once, and refuse impossible transitions. Late,
duplicate, or out-of-order evidence must not regress a terminal canonical fact.

Status vocabularies are not interchangeable between domains. A new status or
transition requires an explicit mapping, persistence compatibility, and tests
for refusal, replay, and ordering.

## Idempotency

Every externally repeatable write has an idempotency scope, a stable operation
identity, and a request fingerprint. Replaying the same logical request returns
the established result without a second durable effect. Reusing a key for a
different fingerprint is a conflict, not permission to overwrite history.

Idempotency keys are opaque values with documented derivation and scope. An
operation, a provider attempt, a customer journey, and an inbound event may
require different keys; do not collapse them into one user-controlled value.
Persist the ledger before reporting success, and make concurrent repeats resolve
to one canonical effect.

## Provider adapters

Domain code depends on a port, not on a provider SDK. An adapter translates the
provider protocol, verification evidence, and failure facts into the port's
neutral contract. It must carry the platform's identity fields without changing
their meaning and expose declared capabilities rather than relying on provider
name checks in domain policy.

An adapter needs conformance coverage for success, refusal, malformed or missing
evidence, duplicate delivery, out-of-order delivery, and retry/replay. Reference
fixtures demonstrate these behaviours without live provider access; they do not
prove a provider integration, release, or support tier.

## Subscription lifecycle

The subscription status matrix has one meaning and several spellings. The
managed SQL guard `public.subscription_guard_status_transition` fires before
every status update. The core engine publishes the same matrix, restricted to
the four statuses it manages, as `SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_TRANSITIONS` in
`@openlup/core/subscription`:

| From | To |
| --- | --- |
| `active` | `paused`, `cancelled`, `completed` |
| `paused` | `active`, `cancelled` |
| `cancelled` | `active` (the owner's win-back) |
| `completed` | none; terminal |

The guard's other edges belong to the activation flow, which the engine never
drives: `pending_activation` to `active`, `activation_failed` or `cancelled`,
and the reopen of an abandoned checkout from `cancelled` to
`pending_activation`, which the guard admits only with an audited
`subscription.activation_abandoned` event. `activation_failed` is terminal.
The core contract test, a pgTAP suite over the guard, and a parity test that
reads the guard's live body all pin the matrix. A change to one side must
update the others in the same contribution.

A matrix edge is not a licence for every operation. Only the owner's pause
request, and the non-payment rule below, may move an active subscription to
`paused`. Only the win-back leaves `cancelled`: it needs a stored payment method
and restarts the schedule two days out.

**The sanctioned non-payment rule.** Nothing suspends, freezes or interrupts an
active subscription except a renewal whose refusals ran past the last rung of
the retry ladder. That cycle has failed, has no retry scheduled and has an
attempt number beyond the ladder's length. It pauses the subscription and
records `subscription.paused` with reason `payment_failed_expired`. A ladder
cut short by a terminating refusal class, or a failure that still has a retry
after it, leaves the dunning case open and the subscription active. The
customer's recovery resumes the paused subscription. It needs a chargeable
method, skips the uncollected cycle and restarts the schedule two days out. A
restart never moves `next_cycle_at` earlier than the stored instant. The
managed SQL side is `subscription_handle_payment_failure_dunning` and
`subscription_resume_after_expired_dunning`. The engine side is
`isDunningLadderExhausted`, `pauseSubscriptionForExpiredDunning` and
`resumeSubscriptionFromExpiredDunning`.

**Known limitation: the portable chain.** The portable PostgreSQL chain in
`db/platform/migrations` does not yet carry this matrix. Its `subscriptions`
table admits only `active`, `paused` and `cancelled`, so it has no activation
statuses and no `completed`. It has no status-transition trigger: each lifecycle
function checks its own source status. It can send a win-back message to a
cancelled subscriber, but no function reactivates a cancelled subscription.
Its dunning rail does pause an active subscription when the ladder
is exhausted. An adopter on the portable chain therefore cannot store a
completed or provisional subscription, and cannot reactivate a cancelled one,
until a forward migration closes the gap under the compatibility lifecycle in
[Data and migrations](DATA_AND_MIGRATIONS.md).

## Subscription delivery alignment

An active subscription must not admit its next renewal while the customer is
still waiting for the preceding delivery. Renewal admission records durable
protection for an undelivered obligation; an already-created
`retry_scheduled` cycle remains existing recovery authority rather than a new
renewal. A delivery that resolves the delay moves `next_cycle_at` to the
delivery or confirmation instant plus the stored cadence. The durable update is
monotonic and uses SQL `GREATEST`, so alignment may extend a cycle but never
move it earlier or stack deliveries on the customer.

A replacement parcel does not erase the obligation merely because it was
created or dispatched. Once a row names an earlier parcel through
`replaces_fulfillment_order_id`, that superseded predecessor is no longer an
outstanding obligation; the latest unsuperseded replacement remains outstanding
until it reaches the customer. Its arrival may settle the predecessor's case as
`aligned` without fabricating `delivered_at` for the parcel that never arrived.

`subscription_delivery_alignment_confirm_replacement` is the service-only path
for recording that a substitute shipment reached the customer when durable
delivery evidence cannot do so. Never use it for an in-flight, lost, or otherwise
undelivered replacement: `aligned` means the delivery happened. Replaying an
already aligned confirmation returns the stored aligned schedule and must not
add another cadence. The ordinary operator-resolution path refuses while an
active subscription still has an unsuperseded undelivered parcel; refusal leaves
the protected case and schedule unchanged.

These are source and persistence contracts, not evidence that any hosted
deployment, provider adapter, or public release has activated the rail.

## Compatibility posture

Stable status, idempotency, and provider-extension commitments wait for `P1-SF`.
Before then, changes must still preserve the contracts above and state their
preview compatibility boundary explicitly.
